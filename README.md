# Head_Pose_Estimation_Mediapipe

## This is a small topic of my research in the laboratory of the Electrical Engineering Research Institute of National Chung Cheng University (CCU)

Python hpe_angle_run is the program that mainly runs Mediapipe head pose estimation

Python hpe_mesh is the program that the mouse on the image can be controlled by the angle of head rotation (pitch, row, yaw).

python hpe_eye is the program that detect the angle of view observed by the eyes (additional, can be modified).
